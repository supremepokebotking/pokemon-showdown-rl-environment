# pokemon-showdown-rl-environment
The Environment I built to study Reinforcement Learning + Pokemon Showdown

## Been a while since I ran this.
Think it is limited to showdown a specific checkout
https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown

# Post clone commands
After cloning, build the Pokemon showdown repo. Only needs to be done once
cd Pokemon-Showdown/
node build --force

I believe python3 agent.py is what you want.
I will look through this later and let you know how to run it. Probably will clean it up too.
